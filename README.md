# About <a name="about"></a>

This project is a fanmade de-make of the Call of Duty: Zombies games. Currently, this is a hobby project of mine serving as
the first project that I am working on within the Unity engine. Although the game is currently within a primitive state, I intend on
working on the project until it is in a state worthy of release.

The main branch of this repository serves as a host for the nightly builds. There is no "playable" build of the game yet, however feel
free to make any comments about the game and its progress. Please don't hesitate to let me know of any issues within my assets, as this 
is my first proper project within Unity and 3D worlds as a whole.

( Please feel free to make some suggestions for a better temporary title too :,) )
